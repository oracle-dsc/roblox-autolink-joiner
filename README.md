# 🚀 Roblox Auto Link Joiner — Discord Based

Welcome to the **Roblox Auto Joiner**, a simple but powerful script that gets you into a Roblox Private Server **automatically** through a **Discord channel**.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **[⬇️ Download the V1.0.0 ZIP](https://github.com/oracle-dsc/roblox-autolink-joiner/releases/download/V1.0.0/V1.0.0.zip) file containing the exe and the config.json or manually build the exe**

2. **Fill out the `config.json`:**  
   Add your Discord Token, the Guild ID (server id), and the Discord channel id.

3. **Launch the script:**  
   Just run the script and press **Enter**.

4. **Open Roblox (It's faster if the Roblox App is already opened.**

5. **Wait until they send a private server link... and BOOM you're in.**  
   The script handles everything else. Sit back and let the magic happen.

## 💬 How It Works

- Listens to a **specific Discord channel** for private server links or game invites.
- Automatically grabs the game link and uses the roblox app to get in.
- Lightweight, fast, and easy to use, it's in cpp one of the fastest programming languages
